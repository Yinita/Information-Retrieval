# Information-Retrieval
This is a code repository for IR Homework by yinita (April-June 2023).

As you can see in there, there are 7 experiment example codes(include the final experiment). In the last few experiments, there are some sensitive data I would not give, so you may need to change it to your own accounts.

## Here is what every experiments did:

### Experiment 1, Task Purpose and Requirements:

#### Experimental purpose:

1. Master the establishment process of Inverted index;
2. Master the merging algorithm of inverted record tables;
3. Understand the simple invocation of Lucene's open source information retrieval library.
#### Experimental requirements:

1. Realize the establishment of Inverted index
2. Implementing Boolean retrieval algorithms

### Experiment 2, Task Purpose and Requirements:

#### Experimental purpose:

1. Master skip pointers technology, proximity search technology, Edit distance calculation method, pronunciation based correction technology, etc;
2. Understand the simple invocation of PorterStemmer open-source programs.

#### Experimental requirements:

1. Given a portion of the location index, please determine which documents match which queries
2. Implement an inverted record table merging algorithm based on skip table pointers, and verify the correctness of the algorithm on the example in Experiment 1.
3. Implement a merging algorithm for two inverted record tables in neighboring search, and make appropriate improvements according to requirements.
4. Implement Dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the Edit distance of two strings

### Experiment 3, Task Purpose and Requirements:



#### Experimental purpose: 
To master the statistical analysis methods of text datasets, as well as the construction and compression techniques of indexes.

#### Experimental requirements:
1. For the 593 documents in the attachment "HW3. txt" (each line represents a document with document IDs ranging from 1 to 593):
Use Chinese word segmentation tools (such as Jieba Chinese word segmentation) to segment text;
Count the total number of tokens and terms in 593 documents;
Build a Inverted index and output the queried document ID
2. Implement VB encoding and decoding
3. Implement encoding and decoding of Gamma codes
